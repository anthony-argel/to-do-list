## Summary
An exercise for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/home). The idea is to create a to-do list using only html/css/javascript.

## Implementation Notes
All of the data is stored and loaded from [local storage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage).

Projects - containers for the to-dos
Todos - little notes that have deadlines and completion status
